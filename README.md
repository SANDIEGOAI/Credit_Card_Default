# Credit Card Default Prediction Project

This project analyzes the [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict the probability of default for credit card clients using various machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Raw and processed data files
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for each analysis step
- `src/` - Python scripts for data processing and modeling
- `outputs/` - Generated figures and models

## Workflow

1. **Introduction** (`notebooks/01_introduction.ipynb`): Project overview and objectives
2. **Data Cleaning/Preparation** (`notebooks/02_data_cleaning_preparation.ipynb`): Data loading and preprocessing
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** (`notebooks/03_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`): Data visualization and insights
4. **Model Selection** (`notebooks/04_model_selection.ipynb`): Model training and selection
5. **Model Analysis** (`notebooks/05_model_analysis.ipynb`): Model evaluation and interpretation
6. **Conclusion and Recommendations** (`notebooks/06_conclusion_recommendations.ipynb`): Summary and next steps

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
